This directory has three subdirectories:

- DataProcessing
Used for converting 10X output (filtered_feature_bc_matrix) to finished Seurat/Scanpy objects for analysis.

- Gene_TCR_Analysis
Runs various analyses using GEX and TCR for both mouse and human. Uses primarily Scanpy objects. 

- AUC_ROC_MarkerAnalyses
Runs various analyses using GEX, TCR, and COMET data on both mouse and human data. Uses primarily Seurat
objects.

- MachineLearning
